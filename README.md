# University-Marking-Software
This project was a coursework required for the completion of my degree

This software will allow either a student or teacher to enter marks into the software, if the user is a student the software will only permit one entry into the system to check whether they passed, deferred, or failed. If the user is a teacher the software will allow multiple entries into the system and once the user is finished entering marks the software will display a histogram of the results.
